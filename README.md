##WordTraining
This is an application fro word training. I made this during my spare time to learn more about Swing and gui development.

##How to use
When you first start the program it will show a pop-up window with a textfield. Here you enter the words using a special syntax.

```English;Swedish;English number 2;Swedish number 2

Just follow that pattern. First the word/sentence in one language, then a semi-colon (;), then the word/sentence in another language.
